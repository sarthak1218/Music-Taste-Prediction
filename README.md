# Music Taste Prediction: Spotify Dataset

This project predicts a Spotify user's music preferences using machine learning models. Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are applied to forecast whether a user will like a particular song based on features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and tempo. The dataset is sourced from Spotify, and the project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and model evaluation to achieve accurate predictions.

## Methods Used:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model that predicts whether a user will like a song based on a threshold applied to the predicted probability.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric model that uses the majority class of the nearest neighbors to predict user preferences.
